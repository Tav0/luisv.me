(Still writing this)

I'm here writing while at the Pearl Hacks 2015 closing ceremony - a lot of
programming girls! I saw great and interesting hacks. Very smart, passionate 
girls and fun to be around! There was a dance session on Saturday night that 
so many people were dancing their butts off to swing, salsa, bachata, and 
hiphop music! 
One group of high school girls made a JavaScript webapp that basically 
challenges sex education in a fun and interactive way! 

***PICS***
Basically, little Lulu is running while avoiding STD and catching condoms to
protect herself. 

This is my first time mentoring, even though my knowledge in JavaScript is
still basic and I just started picking it up from doing [HackWare][hackware-site].
Why not give whatever I know to people!?! Women need more representation in the 
tech communit, and everytime I see more and more programmer girls, which is 
great! Having diversity brings better, and different ideas to the tech field.
I believe if we have a different mindset than just a small group of people
the tech world is prompt to advance faster in technology.
